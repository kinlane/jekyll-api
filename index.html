<h2>Jekyll API</h2>
<p>This is playground to figure out various ways to use Github  Jekyll to emulate API behavior. There are many different approaches, but I want to isolate ways that are 100% Github ran, without outside dependencies.</p>
<p>My first example uses Jekyll for managing the content of an articles API.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="articles.json" target="_blank">Articles</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Each article is a single Jekyll post, with the title as YAML front end matter, and content is the body of the post.</p>
<p>Next I will play with using categories and tags to better filter searches.</p>
